Here you can find my project.
The company gave me two files named "claims.csv" and "contracts.csv"
You should start with the notepad file named "Premium Calculation.R", you can find all the description needed in this file.
Note that to see all the visualizations(tables, histograms and regression models) you need to run "Premium Calculation.R" on RStudio.
Objective: Build a pricing model that you can find in the final file "Model_class_1_me.xlsx"
Hope you like it!
